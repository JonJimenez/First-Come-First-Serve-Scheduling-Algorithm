# First-Come-First-Serve-Scheduling-Algorithm
I implemented the First Come First Serve Scheduling Algorithm
Simply put in the number of processes in the program and run it
It will output a log everytime a process is switched while also printing the current processes in the I/O burst.
At the end of the log it will print the average wait time, average turnaround time, average response time and the CPU utilization percentage.
